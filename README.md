# dz-qb-playerid

A simple script to display the players' network ID over their heads when the `INSERT` key is held down. If you have [dz-qb-holdmap](https://github.com/deandum/dz-qb-holdmap) installed, the player will play an animation when doing this. The idea behind this is to stop people from abusing this functionality and prevent them from using it to their advantage.

## Installation
- Download the script and put it in the `[qb]` directory.
- Restart the server or start the resource from the server console.
